## Problem Description ##

**Tic Tac Toe Checker using Grovers - Basic**

In this problem tic-tac-toe, we are trying to solve  — making a row of 3. But it’s a little more complicated than that. Each turn is a superposition of two moves, meaning your one turn gets split up into a probability of those two spots you play in. 
This is a basic example for a 3*3 board.
We are trying to get a solution for 9 Board Tic Tac Toe. 

## Logic Development ##

Here we will talk about how to use entangled qubit in a closed loop.
